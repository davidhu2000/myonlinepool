# Workflow

1.  create new branch
2.  make changes the branch
3.  create a pull request (PR) with `development` as the base branch
4.  get code reviewed and merge the PR
5.  verify that the changes are functional on [myonlinepool-qa.herokuapp.com](myonlinepool-qa.herokuapp.com)
6.  once the feature is checked, create a PR to merge changes from `development` to `staging`.
7.  verify the function again.
8.  once all checks are good, create a PR to merge changes from `staging` to `master`.
